# AngryBirdsGame

This repository now contains a small Java Swing game inspired by **Angry Birds**. Set the launch angle and power, press **Launch**, and try to hit the target.

## Build

```bash
javac AngryBirdsGame.java
```

## Run

```bash
java AngryBirdsGame
```

The game opens a window with sliders for angle and power. After adjusting them, click **Launch** to fire the bird. A simple physics simulation draws the trajectory and checks whether the bird hits the target.
